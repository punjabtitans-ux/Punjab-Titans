      <p>
          Following the conclusion of the IPL 2026 player auction, Punjab Kings
          have put together a well-balanced squad packed with experience,
          firepower, and promise. The Kings added four new players to their
          roster, featuring a blend of two international cricketers and two
          Indian players, strengthening the team across key areas.
        </p>
        <p>
          Explaining the thinking behind Cooper Connolly’s selection, Punjab
          Kings skipper Shreyas Iyer, who has previously faced the Australian in
          Australia, said: “Honestly, he wasn't there in our mind at the start
          but as we brainstormed and narrowed down our options, we realized he
          fit the position perfectly.”
        </p>
        <p>The new additions to the Kings are:</p>
        <p>
          Cooper Connolly is a dynamic Australian all-rounder known for his
          power-hitting and left-arm spin. Touted as a future star from a young
          age, Connolly captained Australia’s Under-19 side at the 2022 World
          Cup. Between September 2024 and January 2025, he went on to make his
          international debut across all three formats, underlining his rapid
          rise at the highest level.
        </p>
        <p>
          1. Ben Dwarshuis makes a return to the Kings’ camp, having previously
          represented Punjab Kings in IPL 2018. The experienced Australian
          left-arm pace-bowling all-rounder brings a strong T20 pedigree, with
          220 wickets and 1,145 runs in the format, adding valuable depth and
          experience to the squad.
        </p>
        <p>
          2. Pravin Dubey is back in the Kings’ den after being re-signed at his
          base price of INR 30 lakh. The leg-spinner strengthens Punjab Kings’
          Indian spin resources, providing crucial support alongside Yuzvendra
          Chahal and Harpreet Brar.
        </p>
        <p>
          3. Strengthening the domestic core further, Vishal Nishad, a promising
          young Indian talent, joins the PBKS squad. He was also secured at his
          base price of INR 30 lakh, adding depth and future potential to the
          team.
        </p>

        <p>
          The complete squad: Priyansh Arya, Prabhsimran Singh, Shreyas Iyer,
          Nehal Wadhera, Shashank Singh, Marcus Stoinis, Azmatullah Omarzai,
          Vijaykumar Vyshak, Arshdeep Singh, Yuzvendra Chahal, Harpreet Brar,
          Suryansh Shedge, Vishnu Vinod, Xavier Bartlett, Yash Thakur, Mitchell
          Owen, Harnoor Singh, Musheer Khan, Pyla Avinash, Marco Jansen, and
          Lockie Ferguson, Cooper Connolly, Ben Dwarshuis, Pravin Dubey, Vishal
          Nishad.
